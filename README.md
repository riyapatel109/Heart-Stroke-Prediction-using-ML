ðŸ“¢ **Introduction**

Heart stroke prediction is a critical area of research aimed at identifying individuals at risk of experiencing cardiovascular events before they occur. With heart strokes being a leading cause of mortality worldwide, early detection and intervention are imperative for mitigating the associated health risks and improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging machine learning techniques to assess an individual's likelihood of experiencing a heart stroke based on a range of demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. By harnessing advanced algorithms and comprehensive datasets, this initiative aims to contribute to proactive healthcare management strategies, ultimately reducing the burden of heart strokes on healthcare systems and enhancing public health.

ðŸŽ¯**Objectives**

Develop a machine learning-based predictive model to assess the risk of heart strokes in individuals.
Utilize demographic, lifestyle, and medical data to train the model for accurate prediction.
Enable early identification of individuals at high risk of heart strokes to facilitate timely intervention and prevention strategies.

ðŸ“„**Dataset**

The dataset utilized in this project contains a variety of features pertinent to heart stroke prediction, alongside a continuous target variable indicating the occurrence of strokes. It is sourced from reliable healthcare databases and organized into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
